# Win10-Adhoc
Scripts for using ad-hoc on Windows 10

About-
These are scripts that I wrote to make using ad-hoc easier on Windows 10.

Run-
Right-click on the file you want to use and select "Run as administrator".
(check-adhoc-status.bat doesnt need to be run as an administrator)

Files-
create-adhoc.bat: use to create an ad-hoc network
adhock-start.bat: use to start the ad-hoc network
adhock-stop.bat: use to stop the ad-hoc network
check-adhoc-status.bat: use to see the status of the ad-hoc network

Note-
Set the ssid and key that you want to use before running create adhoc.bat
ex: ssid=AdhocNetwork key=YourPassword
